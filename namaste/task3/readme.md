## Task 3: Reporting
The last task focuses on the results reporting.

Namaste Technologies uses Tableau to create reports for the Finance department.
We are also expecting that you can work with Tableau, so you will be able to maintain our existing dashboards and create new ones.

In this context, we would like you to create a public dashboard using https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download

Plug the data you created in the 2 first tasks, and use your knowledge about e-commerce services to provide our financial department with relevant metrics regarding Q1. You're intentionally free to present any metrics you think could be interesting for the Finance department.
Financial numbers should be presented in CAD.

The outcome of this task will be a link to your dashboard.

## Approach
- Design which metrics are needed
- Design different tabs in Tableau for financial metrics
- Use csv from Task 1
- Design dashboard

## Outcome
Link to dashboard - https://public.tableau.com/views/namaste_finance_workbook/namaste_finance_dashboard?:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link
