## Objective
The goal is to determine if there a statistically significant difference in the spending habits of groups A and B.

### Approach
To see if this is feasible we can first start by tabluating the mean spend of group A and B.  
The next thing to do is to set up a null hypothesis.
For comparing two means, the basic null hypothesis is that the means are equal - H0: 𝜇1 = 𝜇2
The next step is to use statistical test to validate the hypothesis.  The usual candidate is the T-test but it has to meet certain critieria.  

These include
- The data are continuous (not discrete).
- The data follow the normal probability distribution.
- The variances of the two populations are equal.
- The two samples are independent. There is no relationship between the individuals in one sample as
compared to the other.
- Both samples are simple random samples from their respective populations. Each individual in the
population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample.
- Reasonably large sample size is used
