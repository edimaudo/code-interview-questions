## Objective

Find out the possible reasons why the difference between the treatment and control shop rate is not a good estimate of the *actual* effect size of the marketing campaign.


## Approach
Effect size is a statistical concept that measures the strength of the relationship between two variables on a numeric scale.  It emphasises the size of the difference rather than confounding this with sample size.

Statistical significance is the probability that the observed difference between two groups is due to chance. If the P value is larger than the alpha level chosen (eg, 0.05), any observed difference is assumed to be explained by sampling variability.  It does not help the marketing campaign team understand the magnitude of differences found. 

Based on the information provided the first thing to do is to review how the estimate is calculated.  
If we assume that X and Y represent the two proportions.  X represents the population being studied. Y is the control proportion. The effect size is represented by the difference h.  ‚Ñé = ùúëX ‚àí ùúëY.  An h near 0.2 is a small effect, an h near 0.5 is a medium effect, and an h near 0.8 is a large effect. 
The next step is to set up the null hypothesis.  The null hypothesis is: h = 0.  A suitable Type I error probability (Œ±) is chosen for the test.
The value of h may not match directly with the value of Y ‚Äì X.  
So even though the difference between the two proportions as statistically significant if the shop rate effect is below 0.2 then it would not be a good estimate of the effect size.  

For this marketing campaign some possible issues that could impact the shop rate would be:

- The reliability of the measurement on which it is based.  If there is massive variation in the data being measure it can cause significant issues the effect size since any measure of a particular outcome may be considered to consist of the 'true' underlying value, together with a component of 'error'.

- The data having a non-normal distribution

- If the wrong standard deviation is used' Ideally, the control group will provide the best estimate of standard deviation, since it consists of a representative group of the population who have not been affected by the experimental intervention.
