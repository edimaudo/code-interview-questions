to be or not to be that is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end them to die to sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation
devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep
to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause theres the respect
that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
the pangs of despised love the laws delay
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
to grunt and sweat under a weary life
but that the dread of something after death
the undiscoverd country from whose bourn
no traveller returns puzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
and enterprises of great pith and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action soft you now
the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons
be all my sins rememberd
o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
is it not monstrous that this player here
but in a fiction in a dream of passion
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wannd
tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect
a broken voice and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
for hecuba
whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba
that he should weep for her what would he do
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that i have he would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
make mad the guilty and appal the free
confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i
a dull and muddymettled rascal peak
like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
and can say nothing no not for a king
upon whose property and most dear life
a damnd defeat was made am i a coward
who calls me villain breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
as deep as to the lungs who does me this
ha
swounds i should take it for it cannot be
but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall
to make oppression bitter or ere this
i should have fatted all the region kites
with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain
remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
o vengeance
why what an ass am i this is most brave
that i the son of a dear father murderd
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
must like a whore unpack my heart with words
and fall acursing like a very drab
a scullion
fie upont foh about my brain i have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaimd their malefactions
for murder though it have no tongue will speak
with most miraculous organ ill have these players
play something like the murder of my father
before mine uncle ill observe his looks
ill tent him to the quick if he but blench
i know my course the spirit that i have seen
may be the devil and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy
as he is very potent with such spirits
abuses me to damn me ill have grounds
more relative than this the play s the thing
wherein ill catch the conscience of the king
